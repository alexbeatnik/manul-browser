# manul_engine/reporting.py
"""
Data models for ManulEngine execution reporting.

Provides structured result objects that capture per-step and per-mission
execution data (timing, status, screenshots, errors).  The top-level
``RunSummary`` is consumed by the HTML report generator (reporter.py) and
can also be serialised to JSON for CI integrations.
