# 😼 ManulEngine — VS Code Extension

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/manul-engine?label=PyPI&logo=pypi)](https://pypi.org/project/manul-engine/)
[![VS Code Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/visual-studio-marketplace/v/manul-engine.manul-engine?label=VS%20Code%20Marketplace&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=manul-engine.manul-engine)

The official IDE for the **ManulEngine Deterministic Web & Desktop Automation Runtime**.

Author, run, and debug `.hunt` automation scripts for E2E testing, RPA workflows, synthetic monitoring, and AI-agent execution — all from a single editor. The extension provides Hunt DSL language support, one-click execution, interactive debug stepping, a Step Builder sidebar, configuration UI, and cache management for [ManulEngine](https://github.com/alexbeatnik/ManulEngine).

ManulEngine is a Playwright-backed runtime that interprets plain-English `.hunt` DSL scripts deterministically — resolving DOM elements with blazing-fast JS heuristics (`DOMScorer` + `TreeWalker`), no CSS selectors, no cloud APIs. Automate browsers and desktop apps (Electron) with the same DSL. Whether you are writing QA test suites, automating repetitive business tasks, or building production health monitors, the workflow is the same: write a `.hunt` file, hit Run.

> The Manul goes hunting and never returns without its prey.

> **Zero AI required. Zero cloud dependency. Zero flakiness by design.**
> Playwright speed. Heuristic precision. Optional local micro-LLMs via Ollama — only when you need them.

## 🤝 Dual Persona Workflow — Automation for Humans, Power for Engineers

ManulEngine bridges the gap between non-technical authors and engineering teams. You don't write selectors — you write scripts.

* **For QA / Business Analysts / Ops:** Open a `.hunt` file and write automation scenarios in plain English — no Python, CSS, or XPath needed. The deterministic heuristics engine resolves elements reliably across UI changes. The same scripts work for testing, RPA, and monitoring.
* **For Developers / SDETs:** No more maintaining thousands of brittle `page.locator()` calls. For complex custom UI elements, write a Python control hook with the full Playwright API. The rest of the team keeps writing plain English — your hook handles the Playwright logic behind the scenes.

## VS Code Extension Features

> Hunt DSL language support, one-click runner, interactive debug runner with gutter breakpoints, Step Builder for plain-English `.hunt` scripts, configuration UI, and cache browser for [ManulEngine](https://github.com/alexbeatnik/ManulEngine) — the Deterministic Web & Desktop Automation Runtime for E2E testing, RPA, synthetic monitoring, and AI-agent execution.

## 🚀 What's New in v0.0.9.5 — Explain Mode & Hover Tooltips

* **🔍 Run with Explain Mode (Editor Title Button):** A new `$(output)` icon button in the editor title bar (top-right) for `.hunt` files. One click runs the hunt file with `--explain` and streams the full heuristic scoring breakdown to the **ManulEngine: Explain Heuristics** output channel. Registered as `Manul: Run with Explain Mode` (`manul.runExplain`) command.
* **💡 Hover Tooltips for Debug Scoring:** After running Explain Mode, hover over any actionable step in a `.hunt` file to see a rich Markdown tooltip showing the top-3 element candidates, per-channel score breakdown (text, attributes, semantics, proximity, cache), winner highlight, and 0.0–1.0 confidence scale — directly in your editor. No terminal or external tool needed.
* **🖥️ Desktop App Testing:** Full support for Electron/Desktop app automation via `executable_path` config and the `OPEN APP` DSL command. Test desktop apps with the same `.hunt` DSL used for web automation.

### Previous highlights (v0.0.9.4)

## 🚀 What's New in v0.0.9.4 — Hardening & Transparency

* **🔍 Explainable Heuristics (`--explain`):** Run `manul --explain tests/` to see the top-3 candidates for every element resolution step, with full per-channel score breakdowns (text, attributes, semantics, proximity, cache). Audit exactly why ManulEngine chose a particular element — or didn't.
* **🧠 Visual Explainability (Hover Tooltips):** Debug mode now auto-injects `--explain`. After a debug run, **hover over any step line** in a `.hunt` file to see the full per-element scoring breakdown (Text, Attributes, Semantics, Proximity, Cache) as a rich Markdown tooltip — attached to the exact line, no output channel needed. During a debug pause, click the `🔍 Explain Current Step` title bar button to trigger an explain action on the paused step.
* **📦 Strict Variable Scoping:** Runtime memory is now a 4-level hierarchy (Row → Step → Mission → Global). `@data:` row values auto-clear between iterations — zero state leakage across data-driven runs.
* **🏋️ Benchmark Suite:** 12 adversarial tasks across 4 HTML fixtures comparing ManulEngine heuristics against raw Playwright locators. `python benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py`.

### Previous highlights (v0.0.9.3)

## 🚀 What's New in v0.0.9.3 — The Scheduler Update

* **📅 Advanced Scheduler Dashboard (Visual RPA Manager):** A dedicated editor Webview panel (`ManulEngine: Open Scheduler Dashboard` command) that scans the workspace for **all** `.hunt` files — not just scheduled ones. The dashboard splits files into **Scheduled Tasks** (files with an existing `@schedule:` header) and **Unscheduled Tasks** sections. A **live search bar** at the top filters both lists by filename. Each file row includes a **combobox** with preset schedule options (`every 5 minutes`, `hourly`, `daily at 09:00`, `Custom...`, etc.) and an **Apply** button that injects, updates, or removes the `@schedule:` header directly in the `.hunt` file — no manual editing required. The dashboard also shows a live status indicator (green when the daemon is running, grey when stopped) and provides **Start Daemon** / **Stop Daemon** buttons. Start spawns `manul daemon <tests_home> --headless` in a dedicated `"Manul Daemon"` terminal; Stop disposes the terminal. The dashboard command appears as a calendar icon in the title bar of all ManulEngine sidebar views.
* **`@schedule:` Header Support:** Hunt files now support `@schedule: every 5 minutes` (and other expressions: `every N seconds/minutes/hours`, `daily at HH:MM`, `every monday`, `every friday at 14:30`). The engine's built-in scheduler runs these files on their declared schedule via `manul daemon <directory>` — no external cron required.
* **🔴 Record Session Button:** The Step Builder sidebar includes a **Record Session** button — enter a URL and click to launch `manul record <URL>` in the integrated terminal, capturing browser actions as `.hunt` DSL in real time.
* **Self-Healing Controls Cache:** Stale cache entries are detected and auto-healed at runtime. `🩹 HEALED` events in the HTML report.

### Previous highlights (v0.0.9.2)

## 🚀 What's New in v0.0.9.2 — The Mastermind

* **🎨 Auto-Formatter for `.hunt` Files:** Press `Shift+Alt+F` (or enable Format on Save) to auto-format any `.hunt` file. Action lines and inline comments under `STEP` or hook blocks are indented with 4 spaces; metadata headers (`@context:`, `@var:`, `@tags:`, `@data:`), `STEP` headers, hook block markers (`[SETUP]`/`[TEARDOWN]`), top-level comments, and `DONE.` remain flush-left.
* **`SET` Command:** `SET {variable} = value` assigns or overrides a runtime variable mid-flight. Both `{braced}` and bare-key forms accepted. Syntax-highlighted in `.hunt` files.
* **YAML-Like Indentation:** Hunt files now support clean hierarchical formatting — action lines can be indented under `STEP` headers. The parser strips all leading whitespace before processing.
* **Enterprise Browser & Electron Support:** New `channel` and `executable_path` config keys in the Config Panel — target installed browser channels (`"chrome"`, `"msedge"`) or custom executables (Electron). Env var overrides: `MANUL_CHANNEL`, `MANUL_EXECUTABLE_PATH`.
* **`OPEN APP` Command:** New DSL command for Electron/Desktop app testing — attaches to the app's default window instead of navigating to a URL. Syntax-highlighted in `.hunt` files.

### Previous highlights (v0.0.9.1)

## 🚀 What's New in v0.0.9.1 — Enterprise DSL

* **Data-Driven Testing (`@data:`):** Declare `@data: users.csv` or `@data: data.json` in hunt file headers. The engine loads each row and reruns the mission with row values injected as `{placeholders}`. Supports JSON and CSV.
* **Network Interception:** `MOCK GET "/api/users" with 'mocks/users.json'` intercepts requests via Playwright `page.route()`. `WAIT FOR RESPONSE "/api/data"` blocks until a matching response arrives. Syntax-highlighted in `.hunt` files.
* **Visual Regression:** `VERIFY VISUAL 'Logo'` takes an element screenshot and compares it against a stored baseline. Baselines saved in `visual_baselines/` next to the hunt file.
* **Soft Assertions:** `VERIFY SOFTLY that 'Warning' is present` records a failure but continues execution. Soft failures surface as `"warning"` status in CLI and HTML reporter.
* **Reporter Warning Status:** Amber `⚠️ Warning` badges, step-level warning styling, soft-errors block, and a "Show Warnings" filter checkbox.

### Previous highlights (v0.0.9.0)

## 🚀 What's New in v0.0.9.0 — The Power User Update

* **`VERIFY ... is ENABLED`:** State verification now supports both `ENABLED` and `DISABLED` checks. The Step Builder includes a dedicated 🔓 **Verify enabled** button alongside the existing 🔒 **Verify disabled** button.
* **`CALL PYTHON` with Arguments:** Hook functions and inline `CALL PYTHON` steps now accept positional arguments — static strings, unquoted tokens, and `{var}` placeholders resolved at runtime. The Step Builder offers four Python step variants: plain call, call with args, call with capture, and call with args + capture.
* **`ENABLED` Syntax Highlighting:** The `ENABLED` keyword is now highlighted in `.hunt` files alongside `DISABLED`, `NOT`, and other state modifiers.

### Previous highlights
* **Normalised Heuristic Scoring (DOMScorer):** Scoring rewritten with `0.0–1.0` float arithmetic. Five weighted channels — `cache`, `semantics`, `text`, `attributes`, `proximity` — combined via `WEIGHTS` dict and `SCALE=177,778`. `data-qa` exact match is the single strongest signal. Penalties are clean multipliers: disabled ×0.0, hidden ×0.1.
* **TreeWalker-Based DOM Scanner:** `SNAPSHOT_JS` walks the DOM with `document.createTreeWalker()` and a `PRUNE` set. Subtrees rejected in one hop — zero wasted traversal. Visibility via `checkVisibility()` API with `offsetWidth/offsetHeight` fallback.
* **Safe iframe Support:** `_snapshot()` iterates `page.frames`, injects snapshot JS per frame, tags elements with `frame_index`. Cross-origin frames silently skipped; stale indices fall back to main frame.
* **Clean, Unnumbered DSL:** Scripts read like plain English (`NAVIGATE to url` instead of `1. NAVIGATE to url`).
* **Logical STEP Grouping:** `STEP [optional number]: [Description]` blocks map manual QA cases directly into `.hunt` files.
* **Interactive Enterprise HTML Reporter:** Dual-mode, zero-dependency reporter with native HTML5 accordions, auto-expanding failures, Flexbox layout, **"Show Only Failed" toggle**, and **tag filter chips**.
* **Global Lifecycle Hooks:** `@before_all`, `@after_all`, `@before_group`, `@after_group` orchestrate DB seeding and auth. `ctx.variables` serialise across parallel `--workers`.

## Features

### 🎨 Hunt File Language Support
- Syntax highlighting for `.hunt` files
- Comment toggling (`#`)
- Bracket/quote matching and auto-closing
- File icon in the explorer

### ▶️ Run Hunt Files
Three ways to run a `.hunt` file:

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Editor title button** | Click the `▶` icon in the top-right of the editor when a `.hunt` file is open |
| **Explorer context menu** | Right-click a `.hunt` file → *ManulEngine: Run Hunt File* |
| **Terminal mode** | Right-click → *ManulEngine: Run Hunt File in Terminal* (runs raw in the integrated terminal) |

Output streams live into a dedicated **ManulEngine** output channel. ✅ / ❌ status is appended on completion.

### 🐛 Debug Mode
Place breakpoints by clicking the editor gutter next to any step number in a `.hunt` file. Then run the **Debug** profile in Test Explorer (or use `ManulEngine: Debug Hunt File` from the Command Palette / editor title).

- Execution pauses at each breakpointed step with a floating **QuickPick overlay** — no modal dialogs, no Cancel button
- **⏭ Next Step** — advance exactly one step and pause again
- **▶ Continue All** — run until the next gutter breakpoint or end of hunt
- **Stop button** — clicking Stop in Test Explorer dismisses the QuickPick and terminates the run cleanly; Python never hangs
- **👁 Highlight Element** — a third QuickPick option that re-scrolls the browser to the persistently highlighted target element and re-shows the pause overlay without advancing the step
- **Linux:** VS Code window is raised via `xdotool`/`wmctrl` and a 5-second system notification appears via `notify-send` when execution pauses
- **Persistent magenta highlight** — the resolved target element is outlined with a `4px solid #ff00ff` border + glow while execution is paused; the highlight is removed automatically just before the action executes
- Debug output streams live into the **ManulEngine Debug** output channel
- Uses `--break-lines` protocol (piped stdio): Python emits a marker on stdout; extension responds on stdin — browser opens and navigates normally on step 1

### 🧪 Test Explorer Integration
Hunt files appear in the **VS Code Test Explorer** as top-level test items (one per file). Two run profiles are available:
- **Run** (default) — runs the hunt normally using the output panel
- **Debug** — runs with gutter breakpoints and the floating QuickPick pause overlay (see Debug Mode above)

For both profiles:
- Each step is shown as a child item with pass/fail status
- Failed steps display the engine output as the failure message
- Steps that were never reached are marked as skipped
- The step tree is cleared after the run so the explorer shows the correct file-level count

### ⚙️ Configuration Panel
An interactive sidebar panel for editing `manul_engine_configuration.json` without touching the file directly.

- **Model** — Ollama model name (leave blank for **heuristics-only mode** — the recommended default)
- **AI Policy** — `prior` (heuristic as hint) or `strict` — only relevant when a model is set
- **AI Threshold** — score cutoff before optional LLM fallback (`null` = auto)
- **AI Always** — always call the LLM picker (automatically disabled when no model is set; not recommended)
- **Browser** — browser engine: Chromium, Firefox, or WebKit
- **Browser Args** — extra launch flags for the browser (comma-separated)
- **Headless** — run browser headless
- **Timeouts** — action and navigation timeouts in ms
- **Persistent Controls Cache / Semantic Cache** — two separate cache toggles: **Persistent Controls Cache** (`controls_cache_enabled`) stores resolved locators on disk per site/page across runs; **Semantic Cache** (`semantic_cache_enabled`) remembers resolved elements within a single run (grants a 1.0 perfect confidence score on reuse, resets when the process ends). Both default to enabled and can be toggled independently from the sidebar
- **Auto-Annotate Page Navigation** — when enabled, the engine automatically inserts `# 📍 Auto-Nav:` comments in the hunt file whenever the browser URL changes during a run (after clicks, form submissions, etc.) — not just on explicit `NAVIGATE` steps. Page names are resolved from `pages.json`; if no mapping is found the full URL is used instead
- **Log truncation** — max length for element names and LLM thoughts in logs
- **Workers** — max number of hunt files to run concurrently in Test Explorer (1–4)
- **Ollama status indicator** — live dot showing whether Ollama is reachable at `localhost:11434`, with model autocomplete from the running instance

Changes are saved to `manul_engine_configuration.json` at the workspace root. An **Add Default Prompts** button copies built-in prompt templates into `prompts/` if they don't already exist. A *Generate Default Config* button creates the file if it doesn't exist yet.

### 🗂️ Cache Browser
The **Cache** sidebar tree shows per-site cache entries created by ManulEngine's persistent controls cache. You can:
- Browse sites and their cached page entries
- Clear the cache for a specific site (trash icon on hover)
- Clear all cache entries at once (toolbar button)
- Refresh the tree manually

### 🧱 Step Builder
A sidebar panel that lets you insert hunt steps with a single click — no typing required.

- **＋ New Hunt File** button — prompts for a name, creates a `.hunt` file with a starter template in the `tests_home` directory (configured via `tests_home` in `manul_engine_configuration.json`, defaults to `tests/`), and opens it
- **🔍 Live Page Scanner** — paste any URL into the sidebar text input and click **Run Scan**; the extension invokes `manul scan <URL>` as a child process with a progress notification, then automatically opens the freshly generated `tests_home/draft.hunt` in the editor — no terminal required
- **Step buttons** — one button per step type: Navigate, Fill field, Click, Double Click, Right Click, Select, Check, Radio, Hover, Drag & Drop, Extract, Verify present/absent/disabled/enabled, Press Enter, Press Key, Upload File, Wait, Scroll Down, **Open App**, **Set Variable**, **Verify Softly**, **Verify Visual**, **Mock Request**, **Wait Response**, **Scan Page**, **🐍 Call Python**, **🐍 Call Python + Args**, **🐍 Call Python → Var**, **🐍 Call Python Args → Var**, **Debug / Pause**, Done
- **🐍 Call Python** — appends `CALL PYTHON module_name.function_name` to the end of the current `.hunt` file with a single click; rename the placeholders and your Python function runs inline as part of the test — no block wrappers needed
- **🐍 Call Python + Args** — appends `CALL PYTHON module_name.function_name 'arg1' {var}` with tabstop placeholders for the module, function, and arguments
- **🐍 Call Python → Var** — appends `CALL PYTHON module_name.function_name into {variable_name}`; the function's return value is captured as a string and bound to `{variable_name}`, available for `{placeholder}` substitution in all subsequent steps
- **🐍 Call Python Args → Var** — appends `CALL PYTHON module_name.function_name 'arg1' {var} into {result}` with tabstop placeholders for the full syntax; combines arguments and return value capture in one step
- **Hooks buttons** — **🔧 Insert [SETUP]** and **🧹 Insert [TEARDOWN]** insert pre-filled hook blocks with `CALL PYTHON module.function` placeholders; **🎯 Generate Demo Test** scaffolds a complete hunt file with setup, UI steps, and teardown in one click
- **Scan Page** — inserts `SCAN PAGE into draft.hunt`; when the engine executes this step it scans the current browser page for interactive elements and writes a ready-to-run draft hunt file to `tests_home/draft.hunt`
- Each click appends to the currently open `.hunt` file and positions the cursor inside the first `''` pair for immediate editing
- Requires the `.hunt` file to be the active editor tab.

### 🔍 Visual Explainability (Hover Tooltips)

No more guessing why a step clicked the wrong element. Run a hunt in **Debug Mode** (via Test Explorer Debug profile or `--break-lines`), then **hover over any step line** in the `.hunt` file. A rich Markdown tooltip appears instantly, showing the full per-element scoring breakdown — Text, Attributes, Semantics, Proximity, Cache — attached to the exact line.

- **Hover tooltips:** Rich Markdown tooltip on each resolved step line — see exactly why the engine chose a specific element
- **Dedicated output channel:** Scoring breakdown is also routed to "ManulEngine: Explain Heuristics" — separate from test output
- **Editor title bar button:** `🔍 Explain Current Step` icon during debug pause for quick access

## 💻 System Requirements

| | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| **CPU** | any | modern laptop |
| **RAM** | 4 GB | 8 GB |
| **GPU** | none | none |
| **Model** | — (heuristics-only) | `qwen2.5:0.5b` |

## Requirements

- **ManulEngine** installed in the workspace or globally:
  ```bash
  pip install manul-engine          # global / user
  # or in a project venv:
  pip install -e .
  ```
- **Python 3.11+**
- **Playwright** browsers (installed by ManulEngine's setup)
- **Ollama** (optional) — only needed as a last-resort self-healing fallback when the deterministic heuristics engine cannot confidently resolve an element
  ```bash
  pip install ollama   # Python client library
  ```
  Plus the [Ollama app](https://ollama.com) running locally with a model pulled (e.g. `ollama pull qwen2.5:0.5b`)

---

## Auto-detection of the `manul` executable

The extension probes the following locations in order (platform-aware):

1. Custom path from **`manulEngine.manulPath`** setting (if set and exists)
2. `.venv/bin/manul` in the workspace root (also checks `venv/`, `env/`, `.env/`)
3. `~/.local/bin/manul` (pip --user, Linux/macOS)
4. `~/Library/Python/*/bin/manul` (pip --user, macOS)
5. `~/.local/pipx/venvs/manul-engine/bin/manul` (pipx)
6. `/opt/homebrew/bin/manul` (Homebrew, Apple Silicon)
7. `/usr/local/bin/manul`, `/usr/bin/manul` (system-wide)
8. Shell login init lookup (`$SHELL -lc 'command -v manul'`) — sources fish/zsh/bash/pyenv/conda init so shims are found
9. Windows: `%APPDATA%\Python\*\Scripts\manul.exe`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python\*\Scripts\manul.exe`

---

## Extension Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `manulEngine.manulPath` | `""` | Absolute path to the `manul` CLI. Leave empty to auto-detect. |
| `manulEngine.configFile` | `manul_engine_configuration.json` | Config file name resolved from the workspace root. |
| `manulEngine.workers` | `null` | Max concurrent hunt files in Test Explorer. Overrides `workers` in config. Leave empty to use the config value (default: 1). |
| `manulEngine.htmlReport` | `false` | Generate a self-contained HTML report after each run (saved to `reports/manul_report.html`). |
| `manulEngine.retries` | `0` | Number of times to retry a failed hunt file before marking it as failed (0–10). |
| `manulEngine.screenshotMode` | `"on-fail"` | Screenshot capture mode: `none`, `on-fail` (failed steps only), `always` (every step). |

---

## Getting Started

1. Install ManulEngine:
   ```bash
   pip install manul-engine
   playwright install chromium
   ```

2. Open your project folder in VS Code. The extension activates automatically when a `.hunt` file is present.

3. Run `ManulEngine: Generate Default Config` from the Command Palette to create `manul_engine_configuration.json`.

4. Open the **ManulEngine** activity bar panel to configure Ollama and cache settings.

5. Open or create a `.hunt` file and click ▶ to run it.

---

## Example Hunt File

```hunt
@context: Login and verify dashboard
@title: smoke_login
@tags: smoke, auth

@var: {user_email} = user@example.com
@var: {password}   = secret

STEP 1: Login
NAVIGATE to https://example.com/login
Fill 'Email' field with '{user_email}'
Fill 'Password' field with '{password}'
Click the 'Sign In' button
VERIFY that 'Welcome' is present.
DONE.
```

See the [ManulEngine README](https://github.com/alexbeatnik/ManulEngine) for the full step reference.

## 🎛️ Custom Controls — Python Power Behind Simple Steps

Some UI elements cannot be reliably targeted by heuristics or AI: React virtual tables, canvas datepickers, WebGL widgets, and similar custom components. **Custom Controls** bridge the gap by routing specific `.hunt` steps to hand-written Playwright Python — while the hunt file stays plain English.

**How it works:**

1. Create a `controls/` directory in your workspace root.
2. Add a `.py` file with a `@custom_control` handler:
   ```python
   # controls/booking.py
   from manul_engine import custom_control

   @custom_control(page="Checkout Page", target="React Datepicker")
   async def handle_datepicker(page, action_type, value):
       await page.locator(".react-datepicker__input-container input").fill(value or "")
   ```
3. Map the URL to `"Checkout Page"` in `pages.json` (editable via the Config Panel).
4. Write a normal `.hunt` step — no special syntax required:
   ```text
   Fill 'React Datepicker' with '2026-12-25'
   ```

The extension runs `.hunt` files via the same `manul` CLI. Custom Controls are loaded automatically on engine startup — no extension configuration needed. Debug breakpoints, Test Explorer integration, and live output streaming all work exactly the same whether a step uses a custom control or the standard heuristic pipeline.

> **Team workflow:** QA authors keep writing plain English. SDETs own the `controls/` directory. The `.hunt` file never needs to change when the underlying Playwright logic evolves.

Pre-compiled regex, single `_preprocess()` pass per element. Clean penalty multipliers: disabled ×0.0, hidden ×0.1
- **🌲 TreeWalker DOM Scanner** — `SNAPSHOT_JS` replaced with `document.createTreeWalker()` traversal and a `PRUNE` set (`SCRIPT, STYLE, SVG, NOSCRIPT, TEMPLATE, META, PATH, G, BR, HR`). Subtrees rejected in one hop. Visibility via `checkVisibility({ checkOpacity: true, checkVisibilityCSS: true })` with `offsetWidth/offsetHeight` fallback. Special exception: hidden checkbox/radio/file inputs remain discoverable
- **🖼️ iframe Support** — `_snapshot()` iterates `page.frames`, injects snapshot JS per frame, tags elements with `frame_index`. `_frame_for()` routes all downstream locator calls to the correct Playwright `Frame`. Cross-origin frames are skipped; transient "frame closed" errors are retried up to 3 times with backoff
- Core engine bump to **0.0.8.9**

### 0.0.88
- **🌐 Global Lifecycle Hooks** — create `manul_hooks.py` alongside your `.hunt` files and use `@before_all`, `@after_all`, `@before_group(tag=)`, `@after_group(tag=)` decorators from `manul_engine` to wire up suite-level setup and teardown in pure Python. Variables written to `ctx.variables` in any hook are injected into every matching hunt as `{placeholder}` data — no per-file `@var:` needed. Works identically whether running with `--workers 1` (sequential) or `--workers N` (parallel subprocesses): the orchestrator serialises shared variables into `MANUL_GLOBAL_VARS` before spawning workers so every browser process inherits the same state
- **🧠 Deep Accessibility Heuristics** — element scoring now uses the HTML `name` attribute as a first-class signal (`name_attr` exact match: +0.0375 text / ~3k scaled; substring: +0.0125 / ~1k scaled). This resolves long-standing issues with modern SPA design systems (React, Vue, Wikipedia Vector 2022 / Codex) where inputs use `aria-label` and `name` as the primary identifiers instead of visible text. No configuration change required — the improvement is automatic
- **Suite-level failure semantics** — `@before_all` failure aborts the entire suite (all remaining hunts recorded as failed); `@after_all` always fires in the `finally` block. `@before_group` failure skips only the matching mission; `@after_group` still runs for it. Cleanup hooks continue past individual errors so teardown is never partially skipped
- Core engine bump to **0.0.8.8**

### 0.0.87
- **📊 HTML Reports** — new `manulEngine.htmlReport` toggle in Config Panel (“📊 Reporting & Retries” section); generates a self-contained dark-themed HTML report with dashboard stats, per-step accordion, and inline base64 screenshots after each run. Report is saved to `reports/manul_report.html` in the workspace root
- **🔄 Automatic Retries** — new `manulEngine.retries` setting (0–10) in Config Panel; retries each failed hunt the specified number of times before marking it as failed. Each retry is a full fresh browser run
- **📷 Screenshot Capture** — new `manulEngine.screenshotMode` selector (`none` / `on-fail` / `always`) in Config Panel; screenshots are embedded as base64 in the HTML report
- All three settings are auto-injected as CLI flags (`--html-report`, `--retries`, `--screenshot`) when running hunts via the extension — no manual CLI arguments needed
- All artifacts (logs, reports) are now saved to the `reports/` directory — workspace stays clean

### 0.0.86
- **📌 Static Variable Declaration (`@var:`)** — declare test data at the top of any `.hunt` file using `@var: {key} = value`; values are pre-populated into the engine's runtime memory before step 1 runs and can be interpolated anywhere a `{placeholder}` is accepted (e.g. `Fill 'Email' with '{user_email}'`). Both brace and bare-key forms are accepted. Keeps test data separate from test logic — no more hardcoded credentials scattered across steps
- **🐍 Dynamic Variable Capture (`CALL PYTHON ... into {var}`)** — `CALL PYTHON module.function into {variable_name}` (or `to {var}`) captures the return value of any synchronous Python function and stores it as a string in runtime memory; use immediately in subsequent steps via `{variable_name}`. Enables mid-test backend calls (OTP retrieval, magic links, DB tokens) without hardcoding values
- **🐍 "Call Python → Var" button in Step Builder** — one-click insertion of `CALL PYTHON module_name.function_name into {variable_name}` scaffold directly into the active `.hunt` file
- **🏷️ Arbitrary Tags (`@tags:`) and `--tags` CLI filter** — declare comma-separated tags at the top of any `.hunt` file with `@tags: smoke, auth, regression`; run `manul tests/ --tags smoke` to execute only matching files (OR logic: file must contain at least one requested tag; untagged files are excluded when `--tags` is active)
- Core engine bump to **0.0.8.7**

### 0.0.85
- Core engine bump to **0.0.8.6** — internal improvements and bug fixes

### 0.0.84
- **🎛️ Custom Controls** — decorator-based Python handler registry (`@custom_control(page, target)`) for complex UI elements (React virtual tables, canvas widgets, WebGL, multi-step datepickers); handlers in `controls/` are auto-loaded at engine startup; `controls/demo_custom.py` and `tests/demo_controls.hunt` ship as a reference implementation
- **🔍 Live Page Scanner in Step Builder** — new URL input + **Run Scan** button in the Step Builder sidebar; invokes `manul scan <URL>` as a child process with a progress notification and automatically opens the generated `tests_home/draft.hunt` in the editor — no terminal required

### 0.0.84
- **⏹ Debug Stop / 🛑 Stop Test buttons** — two new actions in the floating debug QuickPick overlay replace the old implicit close/abort behaviour: **Debug Stop** skips all remaining breakpoints (including user-set gutter ones) and runs the test to the end without further pauses; **Stop Test** sends a clean `abort` signal to Python, waits 500 ms for graceful shutdown, then kills the process
- **Auto-Annotate Page Navigation** — new `auto_annotate` toggle in the Config Panel sidebar; when enabled, the engine inserts `# 📍 Auto-Nav:` comments in the hunt file whenever the browser URL changes, not only on explicit `NAVIGATE` steps (e.g. after a Login button click that redirects to the dashboard). Page names are resolved from `pages.json`; unmapped URLs fall back to the full URL
- **`pages.json` nested format** — page registry now uses a two-level structure: top-level keys are site roots (URL prefix, e.g. `"https://www.saucedemo.com/"`), values are objects with a special `"Domain"` key (site display name) and regex/exact-URL keys for specific pages. Supports multiple sites in one file. Exact URL keys take priority over regex patterns; the `"Domain"` value is returned as a fallback when no page pattern matches but the URL belongs to the site
- **`lookup_page_name` exact-match fix** — previously a root URL key like `"https://www.saucedemo.com/"` would match all its subpages via `re.search()`, overriding page-specific patterns. Exact keys are now checked first
- **Persistent magenta highlight** — when the engine pauses at a debug step, the resolved target element is outlined with a persistent magenta border (`outline: 4px solid #ff00ff` + glow) that stays visible until the user proceeds; the highlight is injected via `<style id="manul-debug-style">` + `data-manul-debug-highlight` attribute and fully removed by `clear_highlight()` before the action executes
- **👁 Highlight Element QuickPick button** — a QuickPick option that re-scrolls the browser to the persistently highlighted target element and re-displays the QuickPick without advancing the step
- **Two separate cache controls in config panel** — `controls_cache_enabled` is now labelled **Persistent Controls Cache** (file-based, disk, per-site across runs) and `semantic_cache_enabled` is labelled **Semantic Cache** (in-session `learned_elements`, +200,000 score boost within a single run, resets when the process ends); both default to enabled and can be toggled independently

### 0.0.83
- **Inline `CALL PYTHON` steps** — `CALL PYTHON module.function` now works as an action step anywhere in the mission body (not just in hook blocks); use it to fetch OTPs, trigger backend jobs, or seed data mid-test without leaving the `.hunt` file
- **🐍 Call Python button in Step Builder** — inserts a `CALL PYTHON module_name.function_name` scaffold with a single click; `ManulEngine: Insert Inline CALL PYTHON Step` command also available in the Command Palette
- **Python Hooks** — `[SETUP]` / `[TEARDOWN]` blocks in `.hunt` files now invoke synchronous Python functions before/after the browser mission via `CALL PYTHON module.function`; setup failure skips mission + teardown; teardown always runs in a `finally` block
- **Hooks buttons in Step Builder** — **🔧 Insert [SETUP]**, **🧹 Insert [TEARDOWN]**, and **🎯 Generate Demo Test** buttons added to the Step Builder sidebar
- **`ManulEngine: Insert [SETUP] Block`**, **`ManulEngine: Insert [TEARDOWN] Block`**, **`ManulEngine: Generate Demo Test`** commands available in the Command Palette

### 0.0.82
- **Interactive Debug Mode** — place gutter breakpoints (red dots) next to steps in any `.hunt` file; run the new **Debug** profile in Test Explorer or invoke `ManulEngine: Debug Hunt File` to step through a hunt interactively
- **Floating QuickPick pause overlay** — when execution pauses at a breakpoint, a floating overlay appears with **⏭ Next Step** (advance one step) and **▶ Continue All** (run to next gutter breakpoint or end); no Cancel button, no modal tab
- **`--debug` CLI flag** — interactive terminal debug mode: engine pauses before every step and prompts ENTER; draws a dashed red border around the resolved element for 500 ms
- **`--break-lines` CLI flag** — gutter breakpoint mode used by the extension; pauses at steps matching file line numbers via stdout/stdin JSON protocol; never blocks the NAVIGATE step
- **`DEBUG` / `PAUSE` step keyword** — inserts an explicit pause at that point in any hunt run
- **Debug run profile** added to Test Explorer alongside the normal run profile
- **Visual element highlighting** — dashed red border injected via JS on the resolved element for 500 ms before each action (active in `--debug` mode)

### 0.0.81
- **Bug fix** — `manul scan <URL> test.hunt` (bare filename as positional arg) now correctly saves to `tests_home/test.hunt` instead of CWD/test.hunt

### 0.0.80
- **Smart Page Scanner** — new `manul scan <URL>` CLI command opens a browser, scans the page for interactive elements (including Shadow DOM), and generates a draft `.hunt` file in the `tests_home` directory
- **`SCAN PAGE into {filename}`** step keyword — same scanner available as an in-test step; use it mid-hunt to capture a page's elements and save a draft for later refinement
- **Scan Page** button added to the Step Builder sidebar
- **Model dropdown fix** — replaced `<input list="datalist">` (rendered offset in VS Code Electron webview) with a plain `<select>` populated from Ollama API; first option is always `null (heuristics-only)`

### 0.0.7
- Fix step-insertion buttons in Step Builder sidebar — inline `onclick` handlers were blocked by VS Code webview CSP; replaced with `data-template` attributes and `addEventListener`
- Fix step insertion when sidebar webview steals editor focus — track last known `.hunt` document URI and use `WorkspaceEdit` for reliable insertion
- New **Step Builder** sidebar panel with one-click step templates (Navigate, Fill, Click, Select, Verify, Extract, etc.) and a **＋ New Hunt File** button

### 0.0.61
- Add `PRESS ENTER` system keyword — submits focused form fields without requiring a visible submit button

### 0.0.60
- Version bump to 0.0.6 — aligns with Python package `manul-engine 0.0.6`

### 0.0.54
- **Real-time step reporting** — hunt steps appear in Test Explorer with pass/fail status *while the hunt is running*, not just after it finishes
- **Bounded concurrency** — Test Explorer now respects the `workers` setting (from `manul_engine_configuration.json` or the new `manulEngine.workers` VS Code setting) instead of running all hunt files with unbounded `Promise.all`
- **Workers combobox** — config panel sidebar exposes a Workers field (1–4)
- **Add Default Prompts** button — copies built-in prompt templates into `prompts/` with one click
- Executable auto-detection now checks `venv/`, `env/`, and `.env/` in addition to `.venv/` — fixes `spawn manul ENOENT` for projects that use a non-dotted venv folder name

### 0.0.53
- Hunt file syntax highlighting, Test Explorer integration, configuration panel, cache browser
- Smart `manul` executable auto-detection across pip, pipx, Homebrew, pyenv, conda, and custom paths
- Per-file workspace root resolution for multi-root workspaces
- PowerShell-aware terminal command (`&` prefix)
