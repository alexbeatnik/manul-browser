[![VS Code Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/visual-studio-marketplace/v/manul-engine.manul-engine?label=VS%20Code%20Marketplace&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=manul-engine.manul-engine)

ManulEngine is a relentless hybrid (neuro-symbolic) framework for browser automation and E2E testing.

Forget brittle CSS/XPath locators that break on every UI update — write tests in plain English.
Stop paying for expensive cloud APIs — leverage local micro-LLMs via **Ollama**, entirely on your machine.

Manul combines the blazing speed of **Playwright**, powerful JavaScript DOM heuristics, and the reasoning of local neural networks. It is fast, private, and highly resilient to UI changes.

> The Manul goes hunting and never returns without its prey.

> **ManulEngine runs on a potato.**
> No GPU. No cloud APIs. No $0.02 per click.
> Just Playwright, heuristics, and optional tiny local models.

## ✨ Key Features

### ⚡ Heuristics-First Architecture

95% of the heavy lifting (element finding, assertions, DOM parsing) is handled by ultra-fast JavaScript and Python heuristics. The AI steps in only when genuine ambiguity arises.

When the LLM picker is used, Manul passes the heuristic score as a **prior** (hint) by default — the model can override the ranking only with a clear, disqualifying reason.

### 🛡️ Ironclad JS Fallbacks

Modern websites love to hide elements behind invisible overlays, custom dropdowns, and zero-pixel traps. Manul uses Playwright with `force=True` plus retries and self-healing; for Shadow DOM elements it falls back to direct JS helpers to keep execution moving.

### 🌑 Shadow DOM Awareness

The DOM snapshotter recursively inspects shadow roots and can interact with elements inside the shadow tree.

### 👻 Smart Anti-Phantom Guard & AI Rejection

Strict protection against LLM hallucinations. If the model is unsure, it returns `{"id": null}`; the engine treats that as a rejection and retries with self-healing.

### 🎛️ Adjustable AI Threshold

Control how aggressively Manul falls back to the local LLM via `manul_engine_configuration.json` (`ai_threshold` key) or the `MANUL_AI_THRESHOLD` environment variable. If not set, Manul auto-calculates it from the model size:

| Model size | Auto threshold |
|---|---|
| `< 1b` | `500` |
| `1b – 4b` | `750` |
| `5b – 9b` | `1000` |
| `10b – 19b` | `1500` |
| `20b+` | `2000` |

Set `MANUL_AI_THRESHOLD=0` to disable the LLM entirely and run fully on deterministic heuristics.

### 🗂️ Persistent Controls Cache

Successful element resolutions are stored per-site and reused on subsequent runs — making repeated test flows dramatically faster.

---

## 🎛️ Custom Controls — Escape Hatch for Complex UI

Some UI elements defeat general-purpose heuristics entirely: React virtual tables, canvas-based date-pickers, WebGL widgets, drag-to-sort lists. **Custom Controls** let you write plain English in the hunt file while an SDET handles the underlying Playwright logic in Python.

* **For Manual QA / Testers:** Keep writing plain English steps. If a step targets a Custom Control, the engine routes it to a Python handler automatically. The `.hunt` file stays readable and unchanged.
* **For SDETs / Developers:** Register a handler with a one-line decorator tied to a page name from `pages.json`. Use any Playwright API inside — no heuristics, no AI involvement.

```python
# controls/booking.py
from manul_engine import custom_control

@custom_control(page="Checkout Page", target="React Datepicker")
async def handle_datepicker(page, action_type, value):
    await page.locator(".react-datepicker__input-container input").fill(value or "")
```

```text
# tests/checkout.hunt  — no change needed for the QA author
2. Fill 'React Datepicker' with '2026-12-25'
```

The engine loads every `.py` file in `controls/` at startup. No configuration required.

> **See it in action:** `controls/demo_custom.py` is a fully-working reference handler for a React Datepicker (with month navigation). `tests/demo_controls.hunt` is the companion hunt file — run it as-is to see the routing in action.

## ⚡ Lightning-Fast Preconditions with Python Hooks

Stop wasting hours on brittle UI-based preconditions. With `[SETUP]` and `[TEARDOWN]` hooks you can inject test data directly into your database or call an API in pure Python — keeping your `.hunt` files crystal clear and your test runs **dramatically faster**.

```text
[SETUP]
CALL PYTHON db_helpers.seed_admin_user
[END SETUP]

1. NAVIGATE to https://myapp.com/login
2. Fill 'Email' field with 'admin@example.com'
3. Fill 'Password' field with 'secret'
4. Click the 'Sign In' button
5. VERIFY that 'Dashboard' is present.

[TEARDOWN]
CALL PYTHON db_helpers.clean_database
[END TEARDOWN]
```

Hooks run **outside the browser**: `[SETUP]` fires before the browser opens; `[TEARDOWN]` fires in a `finally` block — always — regardless of whether the test passed or failed. If setup fails, the mission is skipped and teardown is not called (there's nothing to clean up).

| Block | When it runs | Abort behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `[SETUP]` | Before the browser launches | Failure skips mission + teardown |
| `[TEARDOWN]` | After the mission (pass or fail) | Failure is logged, does not override mission result |

The helper module is resolved relative to the `.hunt` file's directory first, then the CWD, then standard `sys.path` — no configuration needed.

### 🐍 Inline Python Calls

Need to fetch an OTP from the database mid-test? Or trigger a backend job before clicking "Refresh"? You can now call Python functions **directly as standard numbered steps** — right in the middle of your UI flow.

```text
1. FILL 'Email' field with 'test@manul.com'
2. CLICK the 'Send OTP' button
3. CALL PYTHON api_helpers.fetch_and_set_otp
4. Fill 'OTP' field with '{otp}'
5. CLICK the 'Login' button
6. VERIFY that 'Dashboard' is present.
```

The same module resolution rules apply as for `[SETUP]`/`[TEARDOWN]`: hunt file directory → CWD → `sys.path`. Functions must be synchronous. If the call fails, the mission stops immediately — just like any other failed step. No special syntax or block wrapping required.

## 💻 System Requirements

| | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| **CPU** | any | modern laptop |
| **RAM** | 4 GB | 8 GB |
| **GPU** | none | none |
| **Model** | — (heuristics-only) | `qwen2.5:0.5b` |

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
pip install manul-engine
playwright install chromium
```

### Optional: Local LLM (Ollama)

Ollama is only needed for AI element-picker fallback or free-text mission planning.

```bash
pip install ollama          # Python client library
ollama pull qwen2.5:0.5b   # download model (requires Ollama app: https://ollama.com)
ollama serve
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Create a hunt file

`my_tests/smoke.hunt`

```text
@context: Demo smoke test
@blueprint: smoke

1. NAVIGATE to https://demoqa.com/text-box
2. Fill 'Full Name' field with 'Ghost Manul'
3. Click the 'Submit' button
4. VERIFY that 'Ghost Manul' is present.
5. DONE.
```

### 2. Run it

```bash
# Run a specific hunt file
manul my_tests/smoke.hunt

# Run all *.hunt files in a folder
manul my_tests/

# Run headless
manul my_tests/ --headless

# Choose a different browser
manul my_tests/ --browser firefox
manul my_tests/ --headless --browser webkit

# Run an inline one-liner
manul "1. NAVIGATE to https://example.com  2. Click the 'More' link  3. DONE."

# Run multiple hunt files in parallel (4 concurrent browsers)
manul my_tests/ --workers 4

# Interactive debug mode (terminal) — pause before every step, confirm in terminal
manul --debug my_tests/smoke.hunt

# VS Code: place red-dot gutter breakpoints in any .hunt file, then run the Debug profile
# in Test Explorer — ⏭ Next Step / ▶ Continue All / ■ Stop (Stop dismisses QuickPick cleanly)

# Smart Page Scanner — scan a URL and generate a draft hunt file
manul scan https://example.com                    # outputs to tests/draft.hunt (tests_home)
manul scan https://example.com tests/my.hunt      # explicit output file
manul scan https://example.com --headless         # headless scan
```

> **VS Code:** The Step Builder sidebar includes a **Live Page Scanner** — paste a URL and click **🔍 Run Scan** to invoke the scanner without opening a terminal. The generated `draft.hunt` opens automatically in the editor.

### 3. Python API

```python
import asyncio
from manul_engine import ManulEngine

async def main():
    manul = ManulEngine(headless=True)
    await manul.run_mission("""
        1. NAVIGATE to https://demoqa.com/text-box
        2. Fill 'Full Name' field with 'Ghost Manul'
        3. Click the 'Submit' button
        4. VERIFY that 'Ghost Manul' is present.
        5. DONE.
    """)

asyncio.run(main())
```

---

## 📜 Hunt File Format

Hunt files are plain-text test scenarios with a `.hunt` extension.

### Headers (optional)

```text
@context: Strategic context passed to the LLM planner
@blueprint: short-tag
```

### Comments

Lines starting with `#` are ignored.

### System Keywords

| Keyword | Description |
|---|---|
| `NAVIGATE to [URL]` | Load a URL and wait for DOM settlement |
| `WAIT [seconds]` | Hard sleep |
| `PRESS ENTER` | Press Enter on the currently focused element (submit forms after filling a field) |
| `SCROLL DOWN` | Scroll the main page down one viewport |
| `EXTRACT [target] into {var}` | Extract text into a memory variable |
| `VERIFY that [target] is present` | Assert text/element is visible |
| `VERIFY that [target] is NOT present` | Assert absence |
| `VERIFY that [target] is DISABLED` | Assert element state |
| `VERIFY that [target] is checked` | Assert checkbox state |
| `SCAN PAGE` | Scan the current page for interactive elements and print a draft `.hunt` to the console |
| `SCAN PAGE into {filename}` | Same, and also write the draft to `{filename}` (default: `tests_home/draft.hunt`) |
| `DONE.` | End the mission |

### Python Hooks & Inline Python Calls

Optional `[SETUP]`/`[TEARDOWN]` blocks (placed at the top/bottom of the file) and inline `CALL PYTHON` steps (used anywhere in the numbered sequence) all share the same execution model.

```text
[SETUP]
# Lines starting with # are ignored.
CALL PYTHON <module_path>.<function_name>
[END SETUP]

1. NAVIGATE to https://myapp.com
2. CALL PYTHON api_helpers.fetch_and_set_otp
3. VERIFY that 'Dashboard' is present.

[TEARDOWN]
CALL PYTHON <module_path>.<function_name>
[END TEARDOWN]
```

Rules:
- Functions must be **synchronous** (async functions are explicitly rejected).
- A single `[SETUP]`/`[TEARDOWN]` block may contain multiple `CALL PYTHON` lines; they run sequentially — first failure stops the block.
- An inline `CALL PYTHON` step that fails stops the mission immediately, just like any other failed step.
- The module is searched in: hunt file directory → CWD → `sys.path`. No import configuration needed.

### Interaction Steps

```text
# Clicking
Click the 'Login' button
DOUBLE CLICK the 'Image'

# Typing
Fill 'Email' field with 'test@example.com'
Type 'hello' into the 'Search' field

# Dropdowns
Select 'Option A' from the 'Language' dropdown

# Checkboxes / Radios
Check the checkbox for 'Terms'
Uncheck the checkbox for 'Newsletter'
Click the radio button for 'Male'

# Hover & Drag
HOVER over the 'Menu'
Drag the element "Item" and drop it into "Box"

# Optional steps (non-blocking)
Click 'Close Ad' if exists
```

### Variables

```text
EXTRACT the price of 'Laptop' into {price}
VERIFY that '{price}' is present.
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Create `manul_engine_configuration.json` in your project root — all settings are optional:

```json
{
  "model": "qwen2.5:0.5b",
  "headless": false,
  "browser": "chromium",
  "browser_args": [],
  "timeout": 5000,
  "nav_timeout": 30000,
  "ai_always": false,
  "ai_policy": "prior",
  "ai_threshold": null,
  "controls_cache_enabled": true,
  "controls_cache_dir": "cache",
  "semantic_cache_enabled": true,
  "log_name_maxlen": 0,
  "log_thought_maxlen": 0,
  "workers": 1,
  "tests_home": "tests",
  "auto_annotate": false
}
```

> Set `"model": null` (or omit it) to disable AI entirely and run in **heuristics-only mode**.

Environment variables (`MANUL_*`) always override JSON values — useful for CI/CD:

```bash
export MANUL_HEADLESS=true
export MANUL_AI_THRESHOLD=0
export MANUL_MODEL=qwen2.5:0.5b
export MANUL_BROWSER=firefox
export MANUL_BROWSER_ARGS="--disable-gpu,--lang=uk"
```

| `log_name_maxlen` | `0` | Truncate element names in logs (0 = no limit) |
| `log_thought_maxlen` | `0` | Truncate LLM thoughts in logs (0 = no limit) |
| `workers` | `1` | Number of hunt files to run concurrently (each gets its own browser) |
| `tests_home` | `"tests"` | Default directory for new hunt files and `SCAN PAGE` / `manul scan` output |
| `auto_annotate` | `false` | Automatically insert `# 📍 Auto-Nav:` comments in hunt files whenever the browser URL changes (not only on `NAVIGATE` steps). Page names are resolved from `pages.json`; unmapped URLs fall back to the full URL |
